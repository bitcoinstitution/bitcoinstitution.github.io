If you truly understand bitcoin, you already know something most people don’t know

# Humanity is Now in a Global Race.

It’s not a race about AI or robotics — those are obvious.

It’s a race to acquire the only digital money with a fixed, guaranteed supply.

The race is extremely tight, for three reasons:

1. Government money (and debt) across the world is increasing exponentially. And it's unstoppable, making us all stand on a ticking time bomb — only a few years away from detonation.
2. Only 5% of the bitcoin supply is left to mine. Many people/corporations/countries that hold the circulating 95% understand bitcoin — making them reluctant to sell.
3. At this point, it's impossible for other similar cryptocurrency projects with anonymous founders to beat bitcoin's popularity. A project with a well-identified founder might appear simply as the next-generation global central bank.

This race is the biggest wealth transfer in human history. Because...

> Economies that accumulate bitcoin early will outperform those that accumulate later.

So…

If you love your people and your local economy — the place where your loved ones grow and thrive — teach them bitcoin.

Don't worry. This race isn’t about winning gold, silver, or bronze. In this race, every country (or local economy) that runs as fast as it can, wins.

And you — the bones and muscles your local economy needs to run in this race — are responsible for that.

> Because with great knowledge comes great responsibility.

Bitcoinstitution exists to help you fulfill that responsibility efficiently and effectively.

Of course, only if you care about your local economy's future.

# What Is 'Bitcoinstitution' Anyway?

Bitcoinstitution is simply a bitcoin educational institute.

We have a growing number of professional bitcoin educators who allocate at least 4 hours per month to teach bitcoin.

Some of us work full-time, some are business owners. Some are in the crypto industry, others in brick-and-mortar businesses. Some joined already having their own bitcoin education programs and materials, others did not.

What unites us is the belief that standardized, high-touch bitcoin education is essential if we want to raise the quality of learning and amplify the impact.

This is especially true when educating the private sector and the government — the two backbones of every local economy. These audiences prefer B2B engagement and expect professionalism, consistency, and accountability.

In each educational program we run, all educators collectively monitor and supervise its full execution to ensure quality and integrity.

Sounds interesting? Join us.

# Who is Behind Bitcoinstitution?

We are bitcoiners with three different strengths.

1. Ricky Saif, a corporate trainer.
2. Faizal Abdillah, an ex-banker.
3. I Putu Banitama, an engineer.

In 2025, we agreed that a professional bitcoin education body is badly needed.

We then gathered our resources to build the brand, the legal entity, the curriculum, and the network of educators.

We also employ a general manager to run the operation, as all of us are currently employed.

# Our Programs

## Monthly ₿-CERT Certification Exam

The core of a professional education service is a standardized, trustworthy exam. Luckily, the bitcoin ecosystem already has [₿-CERT](https://planb.academy/en/certifications/b-cert). So we partnered with Plan ₿ Academy and host a monthly exam where participants only pay the accommodation cost.

The exam tests your general knowledge of bitcoin. Passing this test is a requirement to be part of our educators. This program is also open to those who don't want to actively teach bitcoin. If you're curious about how well you understand bitcoin, take this low-cost but highly valuable exam.

## Merdeka Finansial (Financial Sovereignty) Training

A very beginner-friendly training — suitable for those who have zero knowledge of bitcoin.

Designed as a good introduction, it's small in size (max. 6 students) and done in two hours.

There’s no remote version, because it’s full of student-centered activities. Learning about bitcoin and the reason for its creation requires a lot of unlearning. Based on our experience, a face-to-face format helps a lot with that.

It covers:

#### 1. The WHY of Bitcoin

You’ll start with a simulation that will show you how broken our current global monetary system is, and why it will only get worse and collapse in the next couple of years. Even conventional investments are at risk because of this. If you rely on conventional assets, then you’re not truly sovereign.

#### 2. The HOW of Bitcoin

After we understand the problem, we show why bitcoin is the ONLY viable solution. Again, delivered with as little lecturing as possible — engaging and enlightening at the same time.

#### 3. The WHAT of Bitcoin

We end with practical, math-based guidance on bitcoin accumulation, to truly set students free by the year 2035. Yes, it includes the demo of buying, selling, storing bitcoin. 

That’s it. The goal is to lay the path to real financial sovereignty in just two hours. We aim to create the most effective and scalable way to pull people out of the real-life matrix.

# Don't Let Your People Fail.
# Help Them Run Faster.

Dear bitcoiner, what can you do now?

1. If you love teaching, please consider to become a [Financial Sovereignty](/) trainer: Attend one of the trainings; Study hard for the [₿-CERT](https://planb.academy/en/certifications/b-cert) qualification; Tell us the place and schedule for your session. We’ll handle the rest.
2. If you prefer not to teach, please help spread awareness of our programs. Refer your bitcoin-skeptic friends and family to the nearest Financial Sovereignty training.

With great knowledge comes great responsibility.

Only if you care enough.

Cheers.

Ricky, Faizal, & Banitama.
