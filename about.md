If you truly understand bitcoin, you already know something most people don’t know

# Humanity is Now in a Global Race.

It’s not a race about AI or robotics — those are obvious.

It’s a race to acquire the only digital money with a fixed, guaranteed supply.

The race is extremely tight, for three reasons:

1. Government money (and debt) across the world is increasing exponentially. And it's unstoppable, making we are all standing on a ticking time bomb — only a few years away from detonation.
2. Only 5% of bitcoin supply left to mine. A lot of people/corporate/country that hold the circulating 95% understand bitcoin — making them reluctant to sell.
3. At this point, it's impossible for other similar cryptocurrency project with anonymous founder to beat bitcoin's popularity. A project with well-identified founder might appears just as the next generation of world's central bank. 

This race is the biggest wealth transfer in human history. Because...

>Economies that accumulate bitcoin early will outperform those that accumulate later.

So…

If you love your people and your local economy — the place where your loved ones grow and thrive — teach them bitcoin.

Because this race isn’t about winning gold, silver, or bronze. In this race, every country (or local economy) who runs as fast as they can, wins.

And you, the only bones and muscles your local economy needed to run in this race, are responsible for that.

> Because with great knowledge comes great responsibility.

Bitcoinsitution exists to help you fulfill that responsibility efficiently and effectively.

Of course, only if you care about your local economy's future.

# What Is 'Bitcoinsitution' Anyway?

Bitcoinstitution is simply a bitcoin educational institute.

We have a growing number of professional bitcoin educators who allocate at least 4 hours of their month to teach bitcoin. 

Some of us work full-time, some are business owners. Some are in the crypto industry, others in brick-and-mortar businesses. Some joined already having their own bitcoin education programs and materials, others did not.

What unites us is the belief that standardized, high-touch bitcoin education is essential if we want to raise the quality of learning and amplify the impact.

This is especially true when educating the private sector and the government — the two backbones of every local economy. These audiences prefer a B2B engagement and expect professionalism, consistency, and accountability.

In each educational programs we have, all educators collectively monitor and supervise its entire execution to ensure quality and integrity.

Sounds interesting? Join us.

# Who is Behind Bitcoinstitution?

We are bitcoiners with three different strenghts.

1. Ricky Saif, a corporate trainer.
2. Faizal Abdillah, an ex-banker.
3. I Putu Banitama, an engineer.

In 2025, we agreed that a professional bitcoin education body is badly needed.

We then gathered our resources to build the brand, the legal entity, the curriculum, and the network of educators.

We also employ a general manager to run the operation, as all of us are currently employed.

# Our Programs

## Monthly ₿-CERT Certification Exam

The core of a professional education service is a standardized trustworthy exam. Luckily, the bitcoin ecosystem already has [₿-CERT](https://planb.academy/en/certifications/b-cert). So we partnered with Plan ₿ Academy and host a monthly exam, where the participant will just need to pay for the accomodation cost.

The exam will test your general knowledge about bitcoin. Passing this test is a requirement to be part of our educator. This program is also open for those who doesn't want to actively teach bitcoin. If you curious about how well you understand bitcoin, take this low-cost but highly-valuable exam.

## Merdeka Finansial (Financial Sovereignty) Training

A very beginner-friendly training -- suitable for those who have zero knowledge of bitcoin.

Designed as a good introduction, it's small in size (max. 6 students) and done in two hours. 

There's no remote version, because it's full of student-centered activities. Learning about bitcoin and the reason of its creation requires a lot of unlearning. Based on our experience, a face-to-face format helps a lot with that.

It covers:

#### 1. The WHY of Bitcoin

You'll start with a simulation that will teach you facts on how broken our current global monetary system is, and why it'll only getting worse and crumble in the next coupld of years. Even the conventional investments are at risk because of this. If you rely on conventional asset, then you're not truly sovereign.

#### 2. The HOW of Bitcoin

After we covered the problem, we'll show how come bitcoin is the ONLY viable solution to solve the problem. Again, delivered with as less lecture as possible. It'd be engaging and enlightening at the same time.

#### 3. The WHAT of Bitcoin

It'll end with practical math-based suggestion on bitcoin accumulation, to really set the student free in the year of 2035.

That's it. The end goal is to lay the path to real financial sovereignty, only in just two hours. We aim to create the most effective and scalable way to pull out people from the real-life matrix.

# Don't Let Your People Fail.
# Help Them Run Faster.

Dear bitcoiner, what can you do now?
